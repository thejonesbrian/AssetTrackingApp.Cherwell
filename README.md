# AssetTrackingApp.Cherwell
A proof of concept application that connects to Cherwell Service Management and hits an API to retrieve data from the database. The Cherwell user enters their login details and can scan barcodes and receive data back about the asset (online). Alternatively, if you were offline then data would be stored and queried when system restored to online again.

This application is protected by a non-disclosure agreement, so I have some pictures available to view.
